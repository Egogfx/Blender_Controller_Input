# Blender_Controller_Input
Using a controller to record input for chosen variables. 

# Notes
I'll be updating this with a better description if I can remember to do so. Forgive all the notation, I'm not a coder, new to Python and only mildly skilled with Blender. I had a goal of using my controller to puppeteer a character, then I wanted to record the action for playback. As it stands, I can record the keyframe data of selected objects, but it runs on Modal timer template and is not very dependable. Sometimes it runs twice in a single frame, sometimes it skips frames. It only stops accurately when 30 fps and under.
